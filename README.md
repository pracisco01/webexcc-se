## Introduction

Contact centers of multisourcing enterprises leverage a combination of sourcing solutions, including captive, outsourced, and offshore. The typical multisource contact-center environment is organizationally complex, consisting of sites located all over the world, and staffed by direct company employees and/or outsourced agents.

In this environment, most locations operate independently and use disparate contact center technologies, including routing, administrative solutions, and reporting tools. This combination of tools and technologies makes both management and quality monitoring across different locations extremely challenging.

Cisco’s Webex Contact Center offers a unique solution that combines contact center and IP technologies in a global call management service. The Webex Contact Center solution is built on the Cisco Midpoint Call Management ® technology, a centralized control point for managing and monitoring calls and contacts across a heterogeneous contact center environment.

Offered as a cloud service, Webex Contact Center provides enterprises with full control over their global contact center queues and creates the appearance of a single, unified contact center environment. Calls, chats, and emails are distributed to the contact center sites where agents are available. When agents are occupied, contacts are queued centrally so they can be serviced by the next available agent irrespective of the physical location of the agent.

In the voice context, by queuing calls centrally, enterprises can offload the queuing function from their premises-based equipment, thus achieving substantial cost savings in telecom hardware, toll charges, and bandwidth use. More importantly, a call can be directed to the next available agent at any site because the endpoint of the call can be anywhere around the globe, Webex Contact Center seamlessly integrates remote agents and at-home agents into the enterprise’s multisource contact center environment.
